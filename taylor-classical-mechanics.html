<h1>Chapter 1 - Newton's Laws of Motion</h1>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>This chapter introduces classical mechanics as using Newton's second law to
solve problems relating forces acting on a body to the motion of that body. We
are taught to view Newton's second law as a differential equation, and we are
forced to familiarize ourselves with basic vector calculus. In Cartesian
coordinates, the expressions for velocity and acceleration are simple, but in
e.g. polar coordinates the unit vectors of the coordinate system are themselves
changing as time evolves and the derivatives result in more complex
expressions. Nevertheless, some problems are much easier to solve using
non-Cartesian systems. We are told that more sophisticated mathematical
frameworks (Lagrangian, Hamiltonian) used by physicists were developed
precisely because they make it easier to work in non-Cartesian coordinate
systems. But before addressing anything like that, we have to understand the
straightforward usage of Newton's second law to solve problems in Cartesian and
non-Cartesian coordinates.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Basics</h4>
<p>The basic object of interest is a moving particle. Its position at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is
<span class="math">\(\r\)</span>. <span class="math">\(\r\)</span> is written in bold because it is a vector. A vector is something
that specifies a direction and a magnitude. Think of <span class="math">\(\r\)</span> as an arrow from the
origin pointing to the current position. Don't think of <span class="math">\(\r\)</span> yet as a column
vector containing numbers, because we haven't said what coordinate system
we're using. Regardless of what coordinate system we use, bold <span class="math">\(\r\)</span> is always
a vector pointing from the origin to the current position.</p>
<p>The particle is moving, i.e. the position changes over time. So instead of just
writing <span class="math">\(\r\)</span>, we write <span class="math">\(\r(t)\)</span> which says that it's a function of time. Think
of that as giving the answer to a question: "At a given time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, what is the
position?". The answer (position) is a vector, so we can say that this is a
"vector-valued function" (i.e. whatever output it gives, it's always a vector).</p>
<p>Its velocity is a function <span class="math">\(\v(t)\)</span> whose value is also a vector (at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>
it's going at some speed in some direction). The velocity function <span class="math">\(\v(t)\)</span> is
the derivative with respect to time of the position function <span class="math">\(\r(t)\)</span>. That
sounds very familiar, but what exactly is the derivative of a vector-valued
function?</p>
<p>In normal, non-vector, calculus we imagine some curve like <span class="math">\(y = x^2\)</span>. So <span class="math">\(y\)</span> is
a function of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. The value of that function is not a vector; it's just a
number (a scalar). The derivative of that function with respect to <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is
saying: at a particular point along the x-axis, if I start advancing <span class="math">\(x\)</span> a tiny
bit, how fast is <span class="math">\(y\)</span> changing? So, it's the slope of the curve at that point
(also just a number, not a vector).</p>
<p>In vector calculus, the derivative of <span class="math">\(\r(t)\)</span> with respect to <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is saying: at
some particular time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, if I start advancing time a tiny bit, where is the
position going and how fast is it going there? So the derivative of a
vector-valued function is a vector -- an arrow with direction and magnitude
(speed).</p>
<h4>Coordinate systems</h4>
<p>Thinking of <span class="math">\(\r(t)\)</span> as an arrow with direction and magnitude is correct but a
bit abstract. How specifically do we use numbers to represent position? The
chapter covers two main coordinate systems. Let's say the particle is moving in
2D space for now.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cartesian coordinates</strong>: we write down how far the particle currently is in
  the x-direction, <span class="math">\(x(t)\)</span>, and how far it currently is in the y-direction,
  <span class="math">\(y(t)\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Polar coordinates</strong>: we write down how far the particle currently is,
  <span class="math">\(r(t)\)</span>, in the current direction to the particle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that both coordinate systems involve recording how far it is in some
direction. The "in some direction" part corresponds to the concept of a <em>unit
vector</em>. A "unit vector" is basically a vector where the direction is of
interest, but the magnitude is just set to 1 for convenience.</p>
<p>Cartesian coordinates use two directions to specify the position. We'll write
these directions as the unit vectors <span class="math">\(\xhat\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\yhat\)</span>. So in Cartesian
coordinates, the position is</p>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td> $$\r(t) = x(t)\xhat + y(t)\yhat$$ </td>
    <td> $$\mathrm{Go~} x(t) \mathrm{~units~in~the~} \xhat \mathrm{~direction} \mathrm{~and~} y(t) \mathrm{~units~in~the~} \yhat \mathrm{~direction}$$ </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>In contrast, polar coordinates just use one direction to specify the position:
the direction of a direct line to the particle's current position. This
direction is the unit vector <span class="math">\(\rhat(t)\)</span>. So in polar
coordinates, the position is</p>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td> $$\r(t) = r(t)\rhat(t)$$ </td>
    <td> $$\mathrm{Go~} r(t) \mathrm{~units~in~the~} \rhat(t) \mathrm{~direction}$$ </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Notice (and this is pretty important; it's basically the reason the chapter is
covering polar coordinates) that in polar coordinates the unit vector
<span class="math">\(\rhat(t)\)</span> is a function of time (its direction changes as the particle moves);
in contrast, in Cartesian coordinates, <span class="math">\(\xhat\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\yhat\)</span> are constant; they
always point in the same direction.</p>
<h4>Velocity</h4>
<p>We can now differentiate these position functions to get the velocity. We know
that the answer is going to be a vector.</p>
<p><strong>Cartesian coordinates</strong></p>
<p>Because <span class="math">\(\xhat\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\yhat\)</span> are not functions of time, differentiating is
straightforward:</p>
<div class="math">$$\v(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\bigg(x(t)\xhat + y(t)\yhat\bigg) = \frac{d x(t)}{dt}\xhat + \frac{d y(t)}{dt} \yhat$$</div>
<p>Physicists use a dot to represent derivative-with-respect-to-time. So they
might write this as</p>
<div class="math">$$\v(t) =  \dot x(t) \xhat + \dot y(t) \yhat$$</div>
<p>Either way, what this is saying is that in Cartesian coordinates, the velocity
function is a vector with an x-speed in the x-direction and a y-speed in the
y-direction. In other words, it's what you expect.</p>
<p><strong>Polar coordinates</strong></p>
<div class="math">$$\v(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\bigg(r(t)\rhat(t)\bigg)$$</div>
<p>That's a product of two things that are both a function of time, so we use the
"product rule" to differentiate it:</p>
<div class="math">$$\frac{d}{dt}\bigg(r(t)\rhat(t)\bigg) = \dot r(t) \rhat(t) + r(t)\frac{d \rhat(t)}{dt}$$</div>
<p>There's quite a few <span class="math">\(r\)</span>s there and it's important at this stage not to get lost
in the symbols. We know that the answer (velocity) is a vector. That means we
can write it as a bunch of things added together, where each thing is a number
times some unit vector. And we're using polar coordinates, so the unit vectors
are going to be the polar unit vectors. So the thing on the left <span class="math">\(\dot r(t)
\rhat(t)\)</span> is fine: that's saying that the velocity has one component which is
the current radial speed (a number <span class="math">\(\dot r(t)\)</span>) in the current radial direction
(the unit vector <span class="math">\(\rhat(t)\)</span>).</p>
<p>What about the thing on the right? OK, so it's slightly harder to understand
but not too bad. We said that in polar coordinates the unit vector <span class="math">\(\rhat(t)\)</span>
changes over time (in contrast to the Cartesian unit vectors). If something is
a function of time then we can talk about its derivative with respect to
time. The thing on the right clearly involves the derivative of the unit
vector. So what is that?</p>
<p>Going back to the informal definition of derivatives above, we're at some point
<span class="math">\(t\)</span> in time, and we imagine starting to advance time a tiny bit, and we look at
the change in where the unit vector points, after this infinitesimally small
amount of time passes. A unit vector always has length 1, so it can't grow in
length. There's only one thing it can do: it can point in a slightly different
direction. What direction has it gone in? It's basically like the hand of a
clock. It's not too hard to see that if the hand of a clock changes just a tiny
bit, then the tip moves in a direction that's almost a tangent to the
circle. Change "tiny" to "infinitesimally small" and the "almost" goes away: so
the time derivative of the radial unit vector is a vector pointing at right
angles to the radial vector. This unit vector in that direction is called
<span class="math">\(\phihat\)</span>, because it points in the direction that you go in when you increase
the angle <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span>, as opposed to <span class="math">\(\rhat\)</span> which points in the direction you go in
if you increase the radius <span class="math">\(r\)</span>. How fast does the radial unit vector move in
the <span class="math">\(\phihat\)</span> direction? The answer is that it moves at the speed that the
angle is increasing, so <span class="math">\(\dot \phi\)</span><sup>1</sup>. In other words, the time
derivative of the radial unit vector is <span class="math">\(\dot \phi(t) \phihat(t)\)</span></p>
<p>The conclusion of all that is that in polar coordinates, the velocity vector is</p>
<div class="math">$$\v(t) = \dot r(t) \rhat(t) + r(t) \dot \phi(t) \phihat(t)$$</div>
<p>I understand that as follows. At time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> the particle might be moving
radially, and its angle might also be changing. The velocity vector has two
components, one in the radial direction, and one in the tangent direction. In
the radial direction, it's moving at whatever speed the radius is changing
with. In the tangent direction it's moving at the speed that the angle is
changing, multiplied by the current radius. That multiplication by radius makes
sense informally, because if you are further out from the center of a circle,
and the circle rotates by a few degrees, then you move further in space than if
you were closer in to the center.</p>
<h4>Acceleration</h4>
<p>The acceleration function is the derivative of the velocity function with
respect to time. Therefore, it is also a vector: at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> the particle is
accelerating by some amount, in some direction.</p>
<p><strong>Cartesian coordinates</strong></p>
<p>Again, because the unit vectors do not change with time, it's as you expect:
there's an x-acceleration in the x-direction, and a y-acceleration in the
y-direction.</p>
<div class="math">$$\a(t) = \ddot x(t) \xhat + \ddot y(t) \yhat$$</div>
<p><strong>Polar coordinates</strong></p>
<p>Because the polar unit vectors change with time, the expression for velocity in
polar coordinates was slightly more complicated. Differentiating again, it only
gets worse. However, the different bits do have physical interpretations.</p>
<div class="math">$$\a(t) = \bigg( \ddot r(t) - r(t) \dot\phi(t)^2 \bigg) \rhat(t) + \bigg( 2\dot r(t) \dot \phi(t) + r(t) \ddot \phi(t)\bigg) \phihat(t)$$</div>
<h3>Newton's second law as a differential equation</h3>
<p>A key point seems to be: view Newton's second law <span class="math">\(\F = m\a\)</span> as a differential
equation<sup>2</sup>:</p>
<div class="math">$$m \ddot \r(t) = \F$$</div>
<p>I'm understanding this as follows: You know what forces are acting on the body
in question. You want to know how the position of the body will evolve through
time: <span class="math">\(\r(t)\)</span>. This is a function satisfying the following differential
equation: the second derivative with respect to time of <span class="math">\(\r(t)\)</span>, times <span class="math">\(m\)</span>, is
equal to the net force acting on the body.</p>
<p>In practice: in a typical problem you have some expression for <span class="math">\(\F\)</span> derived from
consideration of a diagram showing forces acting on the body. You might be able
to discover <span class="math">\(\r(t)\)</span> by finding a function whose second derivative is <span class="math">\(\F\)</span>.</p>
<h4>Example problems</h4>
<p><strong>Cartesian coordinates</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.37 A student kicks a frictionless puck with initial speed <span class="math">\(v_0\)</span>, so that it
slides up a plane that is inclined at an angle <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> above the
horizontal. <strong>(a)</strong> Write down Newton's second law for the puck and solve to
give its position as a function of time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a simple example of using the Second Law as a differential equation. We
write down the forces acting on the particle, set them equal to <span class="math">\(m\ddot r(t)\)</span>
and integrate twice to get position.</p>
<p>The only force acting on the puck is its weight, i.e. its mass times
acceleration due to gravity: <span class="math">\(mg\)</span>. The puck can only move along the surface of
the plane, so we are only interested in the component of the force that acts
parallel to the plane. This component is <span class="math">\(-mg sin(\theta)\)</span>. So taking <span class="math">\(x\)</span> as the
direction up the plane, Newton's second law is</p>
<div class="math">$$ m\ddot x = -mgsin(\theta)$$</div>
<p>Integrating once gives velocity</p>
<div class="math">$$ \dot x = -g sin(\theta) t + v_0$$</div>
<p>Integrating again gives position</p>
<div class="math">$$ x = -\frac{1}{2} g sin(\theta) t^2 + v_0t + x_0$$</div>
<p>and <span class="math">\(x_0=0\)</span> since we start measuring from its starting position.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> How long will the puck take to return to its starting point?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The puck is at its starting point whenever <span class="math">\(x = 0\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">$$0 = t\bigg(-\frac{1}{2} g sin(\theta) t + v_0\bigg)$$</div>
<p>The solutions of that are either <span class="math">\(t=0\)</span> (which we already knew) or (the solution
we want)</p>
<p><span class="math">\(t = \frac{2v_0}{g sin(\theta)}\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Polar coordinates</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A "half-pipe" at a skateboard park consists of a concrete trough with a
semicircular cross section of radius <span class="math">\(R = 5m\)</span>. I hold a frictionless
skateboard on the side of the trough pointing down toward the bottom and
release it. Discuss the subsequent motion using Newton's second law. In
particular, if I release the skateboard just a short way from the bottom, how
long will it take to come back to the point of release?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The point in questions like this is that the radius is fixed: we measure the
location of the skateboard by the angle made by a line drawn from the
skateboard to the centre of the semicircle.</p>
<p>The radius being fixed means that the expression for the acceleration is
simpler, because <span class="math">\(\dot r\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\ddot r\)</span> are zero. So the Second Law describing
how the angle of the skateboard changes is</p>
<div class="math">$$- r(t) \dot\phi(t)^2 = \F_r/m = mgcos(\phi)/m - N/m$$</div>
<div class="math">$$r(t) \ddot \phi(t) = \F_\phi/m = -mgsin(\phi)/m$$</div>
<h3>Conservation of momentum</h3>
<p>Momentum is mass times velocity, <span class="math">\(\p(t) = m\dot \r(t)\)</span>, so another way of
stating the second law is: rate of change of momentum is equal to force. In a
multi-particle system the forces-and-reaction-forces of the third law cancel
each other out when summing the rate of change of momentum of the whole
system. So, total momentum doesn't change due to internal forces (but it does
if there are external forces).</p>
<p>pp 21-23 show that conservation of momentum does not hold when considering
magnetic and electrostatic forces between charged particles moving close to the
speed of light. However I am unfamiliar with those forces and with the
"right-hand rule" for fields/forces and I haven't understood this section.</p>
<hr />
<p><sup>1</sup> You can prove this by writing the unit vector in Cartesian
coordinates, <span class="math">\(cos(\phi) \xhat + sin(\phi) \yhat\)</span>, and then differentiating it
to give <span class="math">\(\dot \phi\big(-sin(\phi)\xhat + cos(\phi)\yhat\big)\)</span> which is <span class="math">\(\dot \phi\)</span>
times a vector orthogonal to the original one.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> The dot means "differentiated with respect to time". So if <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is
position as a function of time then <span class="math">\(\dot r\)</span> is velocity and <span class="math">\(\ddot r\)</span> is
acceleration.</p>
