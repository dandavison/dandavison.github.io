Title: Taylor - Classical Mechanics - Chapter 1

A key point seems to be: view Newton's second law $F = ma$ as a differential equation:

$$m \ddot x = F$$


I'm understanding this as follows: You know what forces are acting on the body in question. You want to know how the position of the body will evolve through time: $x(t)$. This is a function satisfying the following differential equation: the second derivative with respect to time of $x(t)$ is equal to the net force acting on the body, divided by $m$.

In practice: in a typical problem you have some expression for $F$ derived from consideration of a diagram showing forces acting on the body. You might be able to discover $x(t)$ by finding a function whose second derivative is $F$.
